## 2026-02-08 — Day 2: Deploy Architecture & Issues

### Summary
Designed full deploy system architecture. Created 29 GitHub issues (#44-#72).

### Done
- Random agent name + dice button in deploy modal (`b40e022`)
- SSH hardened on control plane (pubkey only, João's ed25519 key)
- Full architecture: Provisioner → Bootstrapper → Agent Daemon → Deploy Orchestrator
- Issues #44-#68: core arch, protocol, bootstrap, provisioner, CI/CD, task execution
- Issues #69-#72: DB migrations, undeploy, settings backend, task cancellation
- Schema review: 3 enums altered, 3 new, 4 new tables, 12 new columns, 8 indexes
- Fixed accidental node_modules commit (.gitignore added)

### Key Decisions
- Pull model (queue) — `SELECT FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`
- VPC private network, no TLS internally
- Immutable deploys (destroy + redeploy to update)
- `running` → `locked` in task_status; `online` removed from agent_status
- Cloud API token in 1Password, settings table holds reference only

### Implementation Order
`#69 DB → #44 Provisioner → #71 Settings → #45 Bootstrapper → #46 Config → #48 Registry → #47 Daemon → #55 Queue → #49 Orchestrator → #50 Dashboard → #70 Undeploy → #72 Cancellation`

### Branch: `dev` — Latest: `b40e022`
